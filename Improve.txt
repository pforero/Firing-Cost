* Improve Feasible Choices
- For G=6
- Matlab  does both in 5 secs
- Julia does EACH in 45 secs
- Check the use of repmat as an option

* Improve Profits
- For G=6
- Matalb fills many values in 46 secs
- Julia fills only profits in 80 secs

* Improve VFI
- For G=6
- Matlab does VFI in 965 secs
- Julia does VFI in in 525 secs
- Need to check if it actually is faster or Eps is smaller

* Improve Structures
- Make sure the change of types is kept to a minimal
